I am a Data Scientist. I have a dual background. Engineering, Applied Mathematics, and Machine Learning. My experience comprehends academic efforts, with a Ph.D. in *Image, Signal and Vision* achieved at the engineering school IMT Atlantique (Brest, France), and my current industrial employment.

Non-professional activities I (unevely) cultivate: (i) Physical activity and fitness, such as Calisthenics, Krav Maga, biking, and hiking; (ii) Reading. I like historical nonfiction, humanities, and geopolitics; (iii) Finally, guitar. To imitate the tunes of 70s, 80s Rock, Blues, and beyond.
